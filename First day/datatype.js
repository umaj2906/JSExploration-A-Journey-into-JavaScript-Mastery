//Datatypes in JS
// there are two types of datatypes in javascript One is primitive and second is non-primitive


// A primitive datatype is a datatype in which we can't change their value oncee we set it.
let a = 24;
let b=a;
b = 25 ;
console.log(a);
// In this value is not changed. this change is only seen in b

// because we are not changing the value of a we are just changing the reference of b to a
// so a is still 24 and b is 25

//primitive{
    //number 
    a=30
    console.log(a)
    console.log(typeof a)
    // string
    Name = "uma"
    console.log(Name)
    console.log(typeof Name)
    // boolean
    istrue = true;
    console.log(istrue)
    console.log(typeof istrue)
    // null
    a=null;
    console.log(a)
    console.log(typeof a)
    // it will give you null type of object and object is  non-primitive type
    // undefined
    a=undefined;
    console.log(a)
    console.log(typeof a)
//}
// Nonprimitive datatypes are those in which if we change it will reflect in its original value

// Non-primitive{

    // Array,object,function

// }
